##App features:
* Registration, and login (logout) with a user name and a password.
* Store information on items (name, price, amount) available at the marketplace in a database. 
* For each user, the server (marketplace) keeps a record of user's activities: the total number of items the user has bought and the total number of items the user has sold.
