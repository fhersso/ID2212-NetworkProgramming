#Client-server guessing game 
##A variant of the two-player "Hangman" game

This is a client-server distributed application in Java for a guessing game similar to the "Hangman" game.

The server chooses a word from a dictionary, and the client (the player) tries to guess the word chosen by the server by suggesting letters (one letter at a time) or a whole word.
